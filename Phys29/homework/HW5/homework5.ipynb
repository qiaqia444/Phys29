    "## Problem 1: Riemann Sums\n",
    "\n",
    "In an upcoming lecture we will learn how to numerically integrate functions in Python. You are all familiar with the concept that an integral \n",
    "$$ \n",
    "I = \\int_a^b f(x) dx\n",
    "$$ \n",
    "is simply the area under the curve $f(x)$ between $x=a$ and $x=b$. You are probably also familiar with the definition of a Riemann integral \n",
    "that approximates this area as a finite sum of vertical rectangular strips, and then taking the limit as the width of the strips goes to zero\n",
    "(you can read more at the Wikipedia article on [Riemann sums](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_sum)). \n",
    "If we use $n$ strips of equal width $\\Delta x = (b-a)/n$, then the Riemann integral can be defined as \n",
    "$$\n",
    "I \\approx \\sum_{i=1}^n f(a + i \\Delta x/2) \\Delta x\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where $f(a + i \\Delta x/2)$ is the value of the function $f(x)$ at the midpoint of the $i$ th strip. In other words, we are using the so-called\n",
    "**midpoint** rule whereby one evaluates the function, $f(x)$, at the midpoint of each interval, which determines the height of each rectangle.\n",

I strongly recommend that you set `plot=False` in your calls to `riemann_sum` for this step! Make a **scatter** plot (i.e. the data should be shown as points, not a curve!) of the absolute error $\\epsilon_{\\rm abs}(n)$ as a function of $n$ with logarithmic x and y axes. From your plot of the data, estimate the value of $\\alpha$ and overplot a curve with $g(n)=A n^\\alpha$, where the constant $A$ is chosen to roughly go through your data points. Make sure you label your coordinate axes and include a legend. You are allowed to use a loop over $n$ for this step. "

    "# Problem 3: Distribution of Household Size and Income in the US\n",
    "\n",
    "The [American Community Survey](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs) (ACS) is a yearly survey conducted by the United States Census Bureau that collects information about the country and its inhabitants.  Download the file [census_income_data.csv](https://github.com/enigma-igm/Phys29/blob/main/Phys29/homework/HW5/data/census_income_data.csv) at this link: https://github.com/enigma-igm/Phys29/blob/main/Phys29/homework/HW4/data/census_income_data2022.csv This is a comma-separated values or **csv** file containing household income data from the ACS. \n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see from the header, it has three columns, `WGTP`, `NPF`, and `HINCP`: \n",
    "- `WGTP` is the weight of the household, or the number of such households in the US population\n",
    "- `NPF` is the number of people in the household\n",
    "- `HINCP` is the household income\n",
    "\n",
    "The `WGTP` is a statistical weight that is assigned to each record (line of the file) that indicates how many people in the population are represented by that record.  In yearly surveys like the ACS, it's not feasible to collect data from every individual in the population, so a subset of the population is surveyed instead.  Each record in the datafile thus represents (or \"stands in for\") a certain number of similar individuals in the population. The WGTP value tells you how many individuals that record represents.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example a line in the file like:\n",
    "```\n",
    "WGTP, NPF, HINCP\n",
    "127, 5, 75000\n",
    "```\n",
    "indicates that in the USA there are 127 households with 5 members per household in them which earn a yearly household income of $75,000. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this problem we want to analyze the distribution of household size and household income in the U.S. population. Given the way that the data is collected, we need to use the WGTP values to get accurate estimates of the distribution across the population. For example, if you want to calculate the total number of households: \n",
    "$$\n",
    "N_{\\rm households} = \\sum_i {\\rm WGTP}_i\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where the sum is over all records in the datafile. \n",

    "N_{\\rm people} = \\sum_i {\\rm WGTP}_i \\times {\\rm NPF}_i. \n",

    "**a)** Read in the datafile into a `pandas` DataFrame `df`. Run the `df.describe()` method on the DataFrame to get a sense of the values in the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "**b)** Assign the `WGTP`, `NPF`, and `HINCP` columns to `numpy` arrays. Calculate the total number of households and the total number of people in the US population using the formulas above.  Print the results to the screen. Do the numbers you get make sense?\n",
    "\n",
    "**c)** According to your result from `df.describe()`, the household income column, `HINCP`, contains negative values. These correspond to households that had a net loss in 2022. For example, suppose a household member owns a business that suffered a loss in 2022 (the business expenses exceeded business income), this would corresopnd to a net negative income. Use `numpy` boolean array indexing to create a new filtered dataset that only includes the records with a net positive household income, i.e. `HINCP > 0`. Recompute the total number of households and the total number of people in the US population using this filtered dataset and print the results to the screen. Use this filtered dataset for all the remaining parts of this problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "**d)** In lecture we learned how `matplotlib` histograms can be used to visualize the distribution in a dataset. Use the `matplotlib` library to create a histogram of the number of persons per household, `NPF` in the dataset. Choose linearly spaced bins of unit width from the minimum value of the `NPF` to the maximum value (make sure your bins include the minimum and maximum value). The $y$-axis of your histogram **should be the percentage of the total number of housholds** contained in each bin, where the the total number of households is the number you calculated in part **c)**. Note that you cannot simply run `plt.hist(NPF, bins=bins)` or `np.histogram(NPF, bins=bins)` because the `WGTP` values need to be taken into account. The `plt.hist` and `np.histogram` functions have a `weights` argument that you can use to construct  weighted histogram and thus take the `WGTP` values into account. Use the arrays returned by the histogram function to explicitly verify that the sum of the percentages over all the bins is equal to 100%, and print this to the screen. \n",
    "\n",
    "**e)** Create and plot a histogram of the household income, `HINCP` in the dataset, again taking proper account of the `WGTP` weights.  Choose linearly spaced bins of width $\\$20,000$ spanning from $\\$0$ to $\\$2,500,000$. As in part **d)**, the $y$-axis should be the percentage of the total number of housholds contained in each bin. Choose a linear scaling for the $y$-axis.  Again, verify that the sum of the percentages over all the bins is equal to 100%, and print this to the screen. \n",
    "\n",
    "**f)** Remake the plot from part **e)** but using a logarithmic scale for the $y$-axis. Which scale do you think is more informative, linear or log?\n",
    "\n",
    "**g)** For the household income histogram, write code that uses the arrays returned to print to the screen the bin index (zero based), the left edge of the bin, the right edge of the bin, and the percentage (up to six decimal places) of the total number of households contained in each bin. \n",
    "\n",
    "**f)** From the `numpy` array that contains the household income histogram output (i.e. what `np.histogram` or `plt.hist` return), compute the **total percentage** of households with an income **greater than or equal to** $\\$500,000$ and print this to the screen.\n",
    "\n",
    "**g)** From the `numpy` arrays that contain the US census data (i.e. `WGPT`, `HINCP` etc.), directly compute the the **total percentage** of households with an income **greater than or equal to** $\\$500,000$ and print this to the screen.  **Note that you are not allowed to use your histogram outputs for this step, i.e. you need to operate on the census data directly.**  Verify that that the two percentages you computed in parts **f)** and **g)** are in agreement with each other.
