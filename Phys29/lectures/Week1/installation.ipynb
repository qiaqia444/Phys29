    "\n",
    "At a high level, GitHub is a website and cloud-based service that helps developers store and manage their code, as well as track and control changes to their code. To understand exactly what GitHub is, you need to understand two related principles:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Version control\n",
    "* Git\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Verison Control\n",
    "\n",
    "Version control helps developers track and manage changes to a software project’s code. As a software project grows, version control becomes essential.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For example consider a real world example that I use for my own research, which is an automated Python based software package called [PypeIt](https://github.com/pypeit/PypeIt \"PypeIt\") to reduce and analyze astronomical data. PypeIt is an open source project that is developed by a team of astronomers and software developers. \n",
    "\n",
    "If a core developer wanted to work on one specific part of the PypeIt codebase, it wouldn’t be safe or efficient to have them directly edit the “official” stable version of source code that is used by hundreds of astronomers. Since, if they were to introduce a mistake or \"bug\" into the code, it break the code for hundreds of astronomers using the code. \n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, version control software enables a developer or team of developers to safely modify code via operatinos called branching and merging.\n",
    "\n",
    "With branching, a developer duplicates part of the source code (called the repository). The developer can then safely make changes to that part of the code without affecting the rest of the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, once the developer gets his or her part of the code working properly, he or she can merge that code back into the main source code to make it official. Typicaly this involves checking that the code still works by subjecting it to a battery of tests. \n",
    "\n",
    "All of these changes are then tracked and can be reverted if need be.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Git?\n",
    "\n",
    "Git is a specific open-source version control system. Specifically, Git is distributed version control system, which means that the entire codebase and history is available on every developer’s computer, which allows for easy branching and merging. According to a StackOverflow developer survey, over 87% of software developers use Git.\n",
    "\n",
    "## GitHub\n",
    "\n",
    "[GitHub](https:http://github.com, \"GitHu\") is a for-profit company that offers a web-based Git repository hosting service. Essentially, it makes it a lot easier for individuals and teams to use Git for version control and collaboration. GitHub’s interface is user-friendly enough such that even novice coders can take advantage of Git. GitHub also develops and distributes (for a fee) GitHub Co-Pilot which is an AI coding assistant that helps developers write code. Without GitHub, using Git generally requires a bit more technical savvy and use of the command line. Additionally, anyone can sign up and host a public code repository for free, which makes GitHub especially popular with open-source projects.\n"

    "### Three ways to run Python code \n",
    "\n",
    "There are different ways to run Python code, they all have different usages. In this section, we will quickly introduce the three different ways to get you started. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Using Python shell or Ipython shell** \n",
    "\n",
    "The easiest way to run Python code is through the Python shell or Ipython Shell (which stands for Interactive Python). The Ipython shell is richer than Python shell, such as Tab autocompletion, color-highlighted error messages, basic UNIX shell integration and so on. Since we just installed Ipython, let us try to run the \"hello world\" example with it. The way we launch either Python or Ipython shell is by typing it in a terminal (see the figure below). Then we can run Python command by typing it into the shell, by pressing `Enter`, we immediately see the results from the command. For example, we can print out \"Hello World\" by typing `print(\"Hello World\")`:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Hello_world](images/01.01.6-ipython_example.png \"Run Hello World in Ipython shell by typing the command, print is a function that we will learn later to print out anything within the parentheses.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above command, the *print()* is a function in Python, and \"Hello World\" is a string data type that we will introduce them later in the book. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Run Python script/file from command line**\n",
    "\n",
    "The second way to run Python code is to put all the commands into a file and save it as a file with extension `.py` (the extension of the file could be anything, but by convention, it is usually `.py`). For example, use your favorite text editor (Showing here is the [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)), put the command in a file called *hello_world.py*:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Python_file](images/01.01.7-python_file_example.png \"A Python script file example using Visual Studio Code. You type in the commands you want to execute and save the file with a proper name.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "Then just run it from terminal:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Run_python](images/01.01.8-run_python_file.png \"To run the Python script from command line, we can type python hello_world.py. This line tells Python that we will execute the commands that saved in this file.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Using Jupyter Notebook**\n",
    "\n",
    "The third way to run Python is through **Jupyter notebook**. It is a very powerful browser-based Python environment, we will talk more about it in details later in this chapter. Here we just quickly see how we could run the code from a Jupyter notebook. Run the `jupyter notebook` in the bash command line:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "jupyter notebook\n",
