Namely, one can approximate the area under a curve by summing over the function values at a set of abscissas, weighted by a set of weights.  Clever choices of absicissas and weights can result in error cancellations that lead to more accurate approximations. This results in a better scaling of the error with the number of function evaluations (strips in our examples) $n$, producing more bang for computational buck.  The actual error depends on the specific behavior of the function over the entire interval, which can be smaller than the theoretical upper bounds we presented above. \n",
