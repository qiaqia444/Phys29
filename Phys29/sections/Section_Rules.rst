TA: Minghan Chen, minghan@ucsb.edu
Office Hour: TBD (will update by next Monday)
Reader (Grader): TBD

- Sign-in at the ipad at the front every time you come to section.

- Format of sections:
  - Practice problems and relevant materials will be pushed (i.e. posted) on the course Github.
  - Go to the "sections/WeekX" folder on github (if you cloned the repository, you can do a git pull and access it locally as well) to find the practice problems. Create a blank notebook (via Jupyter Lab, Jupyter Notebook or Google collab etc.) to work on practice problems in groups of 2 (or 3 if the section has an odd number of people).
  - Section problems are not graded and you are not required to finish them, it is simply designed to help you learn. So try your best to complete as much as you can during the section.
  - Discussion is highly encouraged, please be noisy and help each other out, and don't hesitate to ask questions.

- Please always put "[Phys 29]" in the subject headline when emailing Prof. Hennawi or the TA.
  
- Illnesses and other legit reasons will be excused without penalties to attendance. However, you must notify Prof. Hennawi and/or me in advance (if it's for a lecture, email Prof. Hennawi and cc me. If it's for a section, email me and cc Prof. Hennawi).

- Homeworks are to be submitted as PDFs on Canvas. Late homeworks will not be accepted unless excused in advance.

- AI assistance policies should be covered in lecture and are also available on the course website. Navigate to Canvas, go to the "Home" tab of Phys29, and see "Plagiarism and the Use of AI Assistants" section for guidelines on AI assistance and coding format requirements. Here are some key points:
  - AI assistance on homeworks and on practice problems during section is allowed, but only after attempting them on your own.
  - Tell the AI to turn off code comments in your prompt, and fill in the comments yourselves after understanding the code.
  - AI does not always produce working code depending on your prompt and your coding environment. You are responsible for testing that your (AI-generated) code works and solves the problems.
  - Because we allow AI assistance, commenting your code is essential for the reader to grade your homework. There should be a general "docstring" at the beginning of every function, and then individual comments for non-trivial code lines or blocks as well.
