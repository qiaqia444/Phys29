    "\n",
    "Version control helps developers track and manage changes to a software project’s code. It offers an organized method for multiple developers to collaborate on projects by keeping a record of modifications, additions, and deletions to files over time.\n",
    " As a software project grows, version control becomes essential.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For example consider a real world example that I use for my own research, which is an automated Python based software package called [PypeIt](https://github.com/pypeit/PypeIt \"PypeIt\"), to reduce and analyze astronomical data. PypeIt is an open source project that is developed by a team of around 10 astronomers and software developers. \n",
    "\n",
    "If a core developer wanted to work on one specific part of the PypeIt codebase, it wouldn’t be safe or efficient to have them directly edit the “official” stable version of source code that is used by hundreds of astronomers. Since, if they were to introduce a mistake or \"bug\" into the code, they would break the code used by hundreds of astronomers using the code base. \n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, version control software enables a developer or team of developers to safely modify code via operations called branching and merging.\n",
    "\n",
    "With branching, a developer duplicates part of the source code (called the repository). The developer can then safely make changes to that part of the code without affecting the rest of the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, once the developer gets his or her part of the code working properly, he or she can merge that code back into the main source code to make it official. Typicaly this involves checking that the code still works by subjecting it to a battery of tests. \n",

GitHub’s interface is user-friendly enough such that even novice coders can take advantage of Git. GitHub also develops and distributes (for a fee) GitHub Co-Pilot, which is an AI based coding assistant that helps you write code.
